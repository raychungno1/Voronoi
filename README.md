# Voronoi Diagram Generator

This is a simple Voronoi Diagram Generator created for my [ML & AI Visualizer Project](https://github.com/raychungno1/ML-Visualizer). View the diagram by opening the `index.html` file.

### Implementation Details
The Voronoi Diagram was generated using Fortunes Algorithm, with my implementation heavily based off of [this blog post](http://www.bitbanging.space/posts/voronoi-diagram-with-fortunes-algorithm).

By utilizing Heap and Red Black Tree data structures, we are able to calculate the Voronoi Diagram in `O(nlog(n))` time.
